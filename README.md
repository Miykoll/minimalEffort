# Minimal Effort WordPress Theme
Repository for my minimalistic wordpress theme, where the focus lies on portfolio display and blog posts.

## Why?
I like minimalistic good looking websites, hence the *minimal*, because *Less is more*. 
The CSS is kept to the bare minimum, hence the *minimal effort*. No fancy sidebars, sliding menu's, etc.

## Software used
* OS: Ubuntu 16.04
* GIT (obviously)
* SASS to compile the scss files to a css file.
* Sublime Text 3 as editor 

## Repository structure
* Place this repo in your wp-content/themes/ directory of your own wordpress (so wp-content/themes/minimalEffort/..)
* Using SASS with terminal:
  1. Go to the theme directory (so wp-content/themes/minimalEffort/)
  2. Run the command: sass --watch scss:css --style compressed (Source: minimalEffort/scss/readme.txt)
