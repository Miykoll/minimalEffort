# Telegram instant view template

### STEP 1: Define which pages get Instant View and which don't

# All articles have a class called: single-article which distinguish them from the rest of the website.
# This *condition* tells our Instant View bot to apply rules only to articles
?exists://article[@class="single-article"]

### STEP 2: Define the essential elements

# Now we'll start filling up the IV page.
# To make things easier, we begin by setting up some *variables* before we start our manipulations.
$header: //header
body:    //article

# By default sequences of whitespaces are collapsed into a single whitespace by the browser. The IV bookworm bot does this too, but Telegra.ph preserves whitespaces in the entire article node.
# So we'll use the '@pre' *function* to instruct the IV bot to preserve whitespaces in all of these nodes.
@pre:    $body//*

# Now to fill the essential properties
title:          $body//h1

# <div id="date">1 January 2017, 15:04</div>
@datetime(-2, "en-US", "yyyy-MM-dd"): //div[@id="date"]
published_date: $@

### STEP 3: Further refinements

# Now we'll inline embeds that are wrapped in additional frames using the '@inline' *function*.
@inline: $body//iframe[starts-with(@src, "/media/")]

# published_date: $header//address/@date
@remove:        $body//address
@remove:        //img[@class="wp-smiley"]
@remove:        $body//h5
